### Date:
### Register no.: 212223240037
# Aim: 
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# AI Tools Required: 

## Stage 1: Basic Prompt – Task Creation and Listing

**Prompt Example:**

```
Add the following tasks to my to-do list: Finish report, call mom, and buy groceries.
```

**Expected Response:**

> Got it! Here’s your updated to-do list:  
> 1. Finish report  
> 2. Call mom  
> 3. Buy groceries  

**Purpose:**
To observe how ChatGPT interprets task input in plain natural language and organizes it clearly.

## Stage 2: Intermediate Prompt – Task Prioritization and Scheduling

**Prompt Example:**
```
Organize my tasks by priority and assign suitable times for each today.
```

**Expected Response:**

> Here’s your schedule for today:  
> 🕘 9:00 AM – Finish report (High Priority)  
> 📞 5:00 PM – Call mom (Medium Priority)  
> 🛒 7:00 PM – Buy groceries (Low Priority)  

**Purpose:**
To test ChatGPT’s contextual understanding and logical sequencing abilities — simulating how an AI planner might prioritize and schedule tasks.

## Stage 3: Advanced Prompt – Smart Adaptation and Suggestions

**Prompt Example:**

```
Based on my current tasks and yesterday’s schedule, suggest how I can be more productive today and include one wellness tip.
```

**Expected Response:**

> ***To improve productivity, try completing high-focus tasks like ‘Finish report’ early in the morning.***
> ***Avoid multitasking and take short breaks every hour.***
> ***Wellness Tip: Stay hydrated — keep a water bottle at your desk.”***

**Purpose:**
To demonstrate how ChatGPT can go beyond basic scheduling and provide personalized advice, simulating intelligence and adaptability.

# Procedure:

1. **Define the Core Requirements:**
Identify what the assistant should do — manage tasks, set reminders, and give productivity or wellness suggestions.

2. **Construct Prompts:**
Design clear and progressively detailed prompts for each feature (task management, scheduling, and advice).

3. **Interact with ChatGPT:**
Enter each prompt in ChatGPT and observe how the responses change with prompt clarity and detail.

4. **Evaluate Outputs:**
Analyze the relevance, tone, and structure of ChatGPT’s responses.
Note how small prompt changes can alter the results significantly.

5. **Refine Prompts:**
Reword prompts for precision and natural flow.
Example: Change “Give me some advice” → “Suggest one realistic productivity improvement for today.”

6. **Document Everything:**
Save each version of the prompt and the corresponding response for analysis and final submission.

7. **Simulate Memory:**
Ask ChatGPT to “remember” or “summarize” your previous tasks in context, observing how it maintains continuity across prompts.

## Expected Output (Example Response by LLM):

### Personal Productivity Assistant – Final Features

**🗓️ 1. Daily Task Manager**

- Accepts tasks through natural language.

- Organizes tasks by priority and time.

- Displays pending tasks and daily summaries.

**Example Output:**

> You have 3 tasks today:
> 1. Finish report (High Priority)  
> 2. Call mom (Medium Priority)  
> 3. Buy groceries (Low Priority)  

**🕒 2. Smart Scheduler**

- Detects overlaps in schedule and offers alternate timings.

- Suggests balanced work distribution.

**Example Output:**

> ***You have two tasks at 3 PM — would you like to reschedule ‘Buy groceries’ to 6 PM?***

**💪 3. Wellness Tips Generator**

- Suggests daily wellness and focus tips.

- Adjusts suggestions based on user habits or task load.

**Example Output:**

> ***You seem to have a busy schedule today. Take 10 minutes after lunch to stretch or walk.***

**4. Adaptive Learning**

- Remembers recurring tasks like meetings or routines.

- Suggests habits or schedules based on user preferences.

**Example Output:**

> ***You usually finish your reports in the morning. Would you like me to schedule writing tasks before noon every day?***



# Conclusion:

This task demonstrates that with strategic prompt design, ChatGPT can simulate a fully functional productivity application — managing tasks, offering reminders, and providing personalized tips — without writing or executing any code.
It highlights the power of prompt engineering as a new form of programming where language itself becomes the interface to build intelligent systems.

# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. We were able to:  
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.  
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.  
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.  
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
